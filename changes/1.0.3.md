# Gradle Plugins 1.0.3

This version targets the KordEx plugin.

## KordEx Plugin

This release includes the following changes:

- The plugin now uses the [KordEx Maven repo](https://repo.kordex.dev) instead of OSSRH to resolve and depend on KordEx versions. The plugin now adds this repo before OSSRH.
- Previously, the plugin would figure out the latest version of a Kord or KordEx release by comparing the latest version indicated by the Maven metadata. As this tends to be somewhat unreliable, it now uses [FlexVer](https://github.com/unascribed/FlexVer) to compare all the available version numbers.
- Because of FlexVer, the plugin is now a fat jar, with all dependencies included.

# Gradle Plugins 1.0.2

This version targets the recently released KordEx plugin with a bug fix.

## KordEx Plugin

This release includes the following fixes:

- Previously, the plugin would error on Linux due to a failure to create a directory for the plugin-generated resource files. This was due to Gradle's layout API unexpectedly treating subfiles starting with `/` as if they were within the filesystem root.

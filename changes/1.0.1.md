# Gradle Plugins 1.0.1

This version targets the recently released KordEx plugin with some improvements. We'll update the KordEx template project to use the plugin once we publish this version and the Gradle plugin portal approves it.

## KordEx Plugin

This release introduced several new features, specifically:

- A `mainClass` configuration option, which you should set to your bot's main class, similarly to the `application` plugin or the `Main-Class` JAR manifest. This will automatically configure both the `application` plugin and the `jar` task.
- The plugin now automatically adds the `google()` Maven repository.
- The plugin now automatically configures the Kotlin plugin, setting required compiler arguments and matching Kord Extensions' JVM target.
- The plugin now automatically configures the Java plugin, matching Kord Extensions' source and target compatibility.

It also includes the following fixes:

- Previously, the plugin hard-coded the expected Kotlin version. It will now retrieve the Kotlin version used to build the configured KordEx version (or the latest version if you don't provide one).
